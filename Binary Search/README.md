## Binary Search vs. Linear Search in Python
Welcome to my exploration of search algorithms in Python! This repository contains an implementation of Linear Search 
and Binary Search (iterative and recursive) and a performance analysis.

## Files Included:
```
  linear_search.py
  binary_search_iterative.py
  binary_search_recursive.py
  performance_analysis.py
```

## What You'll Learn:
1. Algorithm Implementation: Learn how to implement Linear and Binary Search.
2. Performance Comparison: Understand how the time complexity affects their execution time.
3. Code Efficiency: Explore the pros and cons of iterative vs. recursive solutions.

## Key Insights:
### Linear Search:

  Complexity: O(n)
  Scans each element until the target is found.
  
### Binary Search:

  Complexity: O(log n)
  Works only on sorted data and uses divide-and-conquer to minimize comparisons.
## Running the Code:
```
  Run the file search_algorithms.py to test all three implementations and view the time taken by each algorithm for different inputs.
  Time taken by linear_search: 0.000010 seconds  
  Time taken by binary_search: 0.000003 seconds  
  Time taken by binary_search_recursive: 0.000005 seconds
```

Applications of Search Algorithms:
-  Database query optimization.
-  Real-time systems for efficient data retrieval.
-  AI search strategies for decision-making.

Future Enhancements:
 -   Implement Jump Search and Exponential Search.
 -  Explore their performance with large datasets.
