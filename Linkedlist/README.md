# Linked List Implementations in Python

This folder contains Python implementations of **Singly and Doubly Linked Lists** as part of my journey to learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Features

### Singly Linked List
- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert at a specific index
- Remove by value
- Remove by index
- Display list

### Doubly Linked List
- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert at a specific index
- Remove by value
- Remove by index
- Display list in both forward and backward directions

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/swordwalid/DSA-python
2. Navigate to the LinkedList folder to explore the code:
   ```
   cd DSA-python/LinkedList
   ```
   
## Usage
```yaml

You can test the code by running the Python files directly or by using the provided Jupyter Notebook to interactively experiment with the linked list operations.
