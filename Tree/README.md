# Tree and Binary Tree Implementations in Python
This repository showcases implementations of various tree structures in Python, including general Trees, Management Hierarchy Trees, Location Trees with level constraints, and Binary Trees. These structures are implemented with diverse methods and include practical applications and traversals.
## Implementations:
### 1. General Tree Structure:
    - Supports hierarchical relationships with methods to add children and print the full tree.
### 2. Management Hierarchy Tree:
    - Extends the general Tree structure to include both names and designations.
    - Customizable printing function to display either names, designations, or both.
### 3. Location Tree with Level Constraints:
    - Adds functionality to limit the depth of tree printing.
    - Useful for displaying hierarchical data up to a specified level.
### 3. Binary Tree:
    - Includes in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal methods.
    - Additional functionalities: finding the minimum and maximum value, calculating the sum of nodes, and deleting specific nodes.
## Key Applications:
    - **Print management and location hierarchies** with flexible view options.
    - **Binary Tree operations** retrieve minimum/maximum values, calculate sums, and traverse the tree in various orders.
    - **Hierarchical data visualization** for real-world applications, such as company structures and geographical locations.
